# Celebrity Dead or Alive App

## Proposal

**- What problem does your app solve?**

People are always arguing about whether or not celebrities are alive. Our app aims to settle the arguments for good.

**- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?**

We’ve gathered information on some of the most influential celebrities around whom debates of this type natural center. By providing incontrovertible results on whether the celebrity in question is dead or alive, we can lay all arguments to rest.

**- What is the mission statement?**

Celebrity Dead or Alive is an app that provides the utmost transparency into the life status of your favorite celebrities and brings closure to some of the most hotly debated arguments among friends.

## Features

**- What features are required for your minimum viable product?**

- Users have the ability to take a quiz without logging in/registering.
- When quiz starts: timer, celebrity picture, celebrity name, and
  buttons “dead” and “alive” appear on the screen.
- Once quiz is complete, a modal appears displaying final score.
- User is presented the option to register an account in order to save their score.

**- What features may you wish to put in a future release?**

Perhaps a dropdown that will allow users to choose from not only celebrities, but public figures of any kind: political, sports, tech, etc.

**- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?**
Some of the top quiz apps offer features such as:

- Quiz creation: create and share quizzes with friends.
- Multiplayer quizzes: play in tandem with other users.
- Varied quiz topics.

## Frameworks - Libraries

**- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?**

FontAwesome, Semantic UI React

**- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?**

No.

**- Are you required to pay to use the API?**

No.

**- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)**
No. It doesn’t appear that any available Apple Frameworks will at this time for this app be useful. However, we will revisit should anything change.

## For Data Scientists

**- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.**

**- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.**

**- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)**

**- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app**

## Target Audience

**- Who is your target audience? Be specific.**

Our target demo is pretty open-ended. Anyone can use our app to quiz their knowledge on celebrity life status. However, the information we’ve gathered about specific celebrities might be more relevant to individuals aged 30+.

**- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?**

**N/A**

**- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?**

**N/A**

## Research

**- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.**

## Prototype Key Feature(s)

**- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.**
